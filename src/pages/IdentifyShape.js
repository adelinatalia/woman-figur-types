                <h2>Identifying the Shape of Your Body</h2>
                <h3>Measure Yourself</h3>
                <p>You might be able to figure out your body type just by looking at yourself in the full-size mirror with no clothes on, or just your underwear.</p>
                <p>However, if you want to be more specific, the best method is to take some measurements, so grab a tape measure.</p>
                <p>Body shape is based on those factors - not on your weight. Understanding and accepting your body type is a lovely step towards self-love.</p>

                <h3>Measurements</h3>

                <h4>Shoulders</h4>
                <p>Stand up straight and relaxed, and wrap the measuring tape around the top of your shoulders, at their broadest point above the shoulder blades.</p>

                <h4>Bust</h4>
                <p>Stand normally, and wrap the measuring tape around the fullest part of your bust without compressing your chest.</p>

                <h4>Waist</h4>
                <p>Wrap the measuring tape around the narrowest part of your waist, usually located just above the belly button.</p>

                <h1>Hips</h1>
                <p>Place the measuring tape around the fullest part of your hip, including the butt, just below your hip bones.</p>
